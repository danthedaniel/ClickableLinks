# ClickableLinks (Fork)
liberate your server from the anti-link-clicking bourgeois. paper plugin to restore chat message link clickability on 1.20.1

## Fork Additions

* Adds permission `clickablelinks.enabled` so only some users can get the functionality
* Changes regex so it won't match URLs without a leading `https?://`
* Gives links a blue color and an underline
* Builds against Paper 1.21
